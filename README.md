# Judo dApp Version 3: Case Study

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Description
The Ethereum Judo Belt System dApp is a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) on the Ethereum network designed to manage and track the progression of students in a Judo Belt System. It enables black belt instructors (senseis) to register new students, promote them through different belt levels, and view their current belt levels in real-time, all secured by the Ethereum blockchain.

## Technologies Used
- **Solidity:** Smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Front-end user interface.
- **Truffle:** Development framework for Ethereum.
- **Ganache:** Personal blockchain for Ethereum development.
- **Web3.js:** Ethereum JavaScript API for interacting with the blockchain.
- **MetaMask:** Browser-based Ethereum wallet.

## Modular Smart Contract Architecture
The dApp's architecture is centered around a modular smart contract, `JudoBeltSystem.sol`, which enhances flexibility and scalability. This contract integrates the functionalities of managing judokas, their belt levels, and point system for promotions.

### JudoBeltSystem.sol
- Central contract for managing judokas' belt levels and points.
- Allows black belts to register new judokas and promote existing ones.
- Facilitates the viewing of judokas' current belt levels and accumulated points.

## Front-End Interface
The front-end is a user-friendly interface developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, interacting with the smart contract via Web3.js. It offers functionalities such as:
- Registering new judokas.
- Promoting students to higher belts.
- Viewing real-time belt levels and points.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository: Get the code on your local machine.
2. Install Truffle and Ganache: Set up a local blockchain environment for testing and development.
3. Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts: Use Truffle to deploy contracts on your local blockchain.
4. Connect to MetaMask: Configure MetaMask for your local Ethereum blockchain.

## Usage Guide
- Open `index.html` in your browser to interact with the dApp.
- Connect MetaMask to transact on the Ethereum network.
- Register, promote, and view judokas' belt levels and points directly through the dApp.

## Roadmap and Future Developments
We are committed to evolving this dApp to meet the growing needs of the Judo community. Our roadmap includes:

1. **Event Logging for Promotions and Registrations:** Enhance smart contract events to include additional information like timestamps and previous belt levels.

2. **Certification or Achievement System:** Issue digital certificates or NFTs for milestones.

3. **Competition Management:** Manage competitions including registration, scheduling, results recording, and ranking updates.

4. **Training Logs and Progress Tracking:** Develop a user interface for judokas to log their training activities.

5. **Decentralized Voting for Decisions:** Implement a voting contract for community decision-making.

6. **Feedback and Endorsement System:** Develop a system for judokas to leave feedback or endorsements.

7. **Membership and Subscription Management:** Integrate payment gateways for handling subscriptions and membership renewals.

8. **Integration with Wearable Devices:** Work on integrating data from wearable devices for enhanced training insights.

9. **Online Learning and Certification:** Develop an e-learning platform with educational content and certification tracking.

10. **Marketplace for Judo Gear and Merchandise:** Create a decentralized marketplace for trading gear and merchandise.

We plan to execute these features in phases, starting with simpler implementations and gradually moving towards more complex and ambitious projects. Regular community feedback and collaboration will be key in shaping the future of this dApp.

## Introduction
Welcome to Version 3 of the Judo dApp! This version is a major step forward in our journey to revolutionize how judo practitioners and gyms interact with the sport. We are introducing a case study with a focus on practicality, usability, and scalability. Our goal is to eventually launch this dApp on the Ethereum mainnet, making it a real-world application for judo communities globally.

## Project Overview
In this version, we aim to create a more structured, user-friendly, and efficient decentralized application (dApp) for judo practitioners. We will focus on:

- Enhancing judoka registration with additional details.
- Improving data retrieval and management.
- Structuring the web application for easy and intuitive use.
- Upgrading smart contracts for better performance and security.
- Collecting and implementing feedback for continuous improvement.

## Case Study Scope
We will test this version with a select group of up to 10 judokas from a local gym. This will allow us to gather valuable insights and make necessary adjustments before a broader launch.

## Sprint Plan
Our development process will follow the Scrum methodology, divided into two-week sprints. Here's a brief overview of each sprint's objectives:

### Sprint 1: Initial Setup and Basic Framework
Setting up the development environment and starting the basic structure of the dApp.

### Sprint 2: Judoka Registration Backend
Developing backend functionality for judoka registration.

### Sprint 3: Front-end Development for Viewing Judokas
Creating a user-friendly interface for viewing registered judokas.

### Sprint 4: Smart Contract Enhancement and Data Retrieval
Enhancing smart contract for efficient data retrieval and admin functions.

### Sprint 5: Completion of Judoka Profile and Feedback Integration
Finalizing individual judoka profiles and starting to integrate user feedback.

### Sprint 6: Competition Management and Additional Features
Beginning work on competition management and additional features.

### Sprint 7: Testing, Refinement, and Documentation
Conducting extensive testing, refining features, and documenting the project.

### Sprint 8: Preparation for Mainnet Launch
Final preparations for launching the dApp on the main Ethereum network.

## Conclusion
This project is not only a portfolio piece but also a stepping stone towards a fully functional application on the Ethereum mainnet. We are committed to creating a product that truly serves the judo community and showcases the potential of blockchain technology in sports management.
