# Judo dApp Version 3: Case Study

## Introduction
Welcome to Version 3 of the Judo dApp! This version is a major step forward in our journey to revolutionize how judo practitioners and gyms interact with the sport. We are introducing a case study with a focus on practicality, usability, and scalability. Our goal is to eventually launch this dApp on the Ethereum mainnet, making it a real-world application for judo communities globally.

## Project Overview
In this version, we aim to create a more structured, user-friendly, and efficient decentralized application (dApp) for judo practitioners. We will focus on:

- Enhancing judoka registration with additional details.
- Improving data retrieval and management.
- Structuring the web application for easy and intuitive use.
- Upgrading smart contracts for better performance and security.
- Collecting and implementing feedback for continuous improvement.

## Case Study Scope
We will test this version with a select group of up to 10 judokas from a local gym. This will allow us to gather valuable insights and make necessary adjustments before a broader launch.

## Sprint Plan
Our development process will follow the Scrum methodology, divided into two-week sprints. Here's a brief overview of each sprint's objectives:

### Sprint 1: Initial Setup and Basic Framework
Setting up the development environment and starting the basic structure of the dApp.

### Sprint 2: Judoka Registration Backend
Developing backend functionality for judoka registration.

### Sprint 3: Front-end Development for Viewing Judokas
Creating a user-friendly interface for viewing registered judokas.

### Sprint 4: Smart Contract Enhancement and Data Retrieval
Enhancing smart contract for efficient data retrieval and admin functions.

### Sprint 5: Completion of Judoka Profile and Feedback Integration
Finalizing individual judoka profiles and starting to integrate user feedback.

### Sprint 6: Competition Management and Additional Features
Beginning work on competition management and additional features.

### Sprint 7: Testing, Refinement, and Documentation
Conducting extensive testing, refining features, and documenting the project.

### Sprint 8: Preparation for Mainnet Launch
Final preparations for launching the dApp on the main Ethereum network.

## Conclusion
This project is not only a portfolio piece but also a stepping stone towards a fully functional application on the Ethereum mainnet. We are committed to creating a product that truly serves the judo community and showcases the potential of blockchain technology in sports management.
