# Judo dApp Version 3: Case Study

## Description
The Ethereum Judo Belt System dApp is a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) on the Ethereum network designed to manage and track the progression of students in a Judo Belt System. It enables black belt instructors (senseis) to register new students, promote them through different belt levels, and view their current belt levels in real-time, all secured by the Ethereum blockchain.

## Technologies Used
- **Solidity:** Smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Front-end user interface.
- **Truffle:** Development framework for Ethereum.
- **Ganache:** Personal blockchain for Ethereum development.
- **Web3.js:** Ethereum JavaScript API for interacting with the blockchain.
- **MetaMask:** Browser-based Ethereum wallet.

## Modular Smart Contract Architecture
The dApp's architecture is centered around a modular smart contract, `JudoBeltSystem.sol`, which enhances flexibility and scalability. This contract integrates the functionalities of managing judokas, their belt levels, and point system for promotions.

### JudoBeltSystem.sol
- Central contract for managing judokas' belt levels and points.
- Allows black belts to register new judokas and promote existing ones.
- Facilitates the viewing of judokas' current belt levels and accumulated points.

## Front-End Interface
The front-end is a user-friendly interface developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, interacting with the smart contract via Web3.js. It offers functionalities such as:
- Registering new judokas.
- Promoting students to higher belts.
- Viewing real-time belt levels and points.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository: Get the code on your local machine.
2. Install Truffle and Ganache: Set up a local blockchain environment for testing and development.
3. Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts: Use Truffle to deploy contracts on your local blockchain.
4. Connect to MetaMask: Configure MetaMask for your local Ethereum blockchain.

## Usage Guide
- Open `index.html` in your browser to interact with the dApp.
- Connect MetaMask to transact on the Ethereum network.
- Register, promote, and view judokas' belt levels and points directly through the dApp.

## Roadmap and Future Developments
We are committed to evolving this dApp to meet the growing needs of the Judo community. Our roadmap includes:

1. **Event Logging for Promotions and Registrations:** Enhance smart contract events to include additional information like timestamps and previous belt levels.

2. **Certification or Achievement System:** Issue digital certificates or NFTs for milestones.

3. **Competition Management:** Manage competitions including registration, scheduling, results recording, and ranking updates.

4. **Training Logs and Progress Tracking:** Develop a user interface for judokas to log their training activities.

5. **Decentralized Voting for Decisions:** Implement a voting contract for community decision-making.

6. **Feedback and Endorsement System:** Develop a system for judokas to leave feedback or endorsements.

7. **Membership and Subscription Management:** Integrate payment gateways for handling subscriptions and membership renewals.

8. **Integration with Wearable Devices:** Work on integrating data from wearable devices for enhanced training insights.

9. **Online Learning and Certification:** Develop an e-learning platform with educational content and certification tracking.

10. **Marketplace for Judo Gear and Merchandise:** Create a decentralized marketplace for trading gear and merchandise.

We plan to execute these features in phases, starting with simpler implementations and gradually moving towards more complex and ambitious projects. Regular community feedback and collaboration will be key in shaping the future of this dApp.
